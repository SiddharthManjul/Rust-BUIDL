Code Execution in rust starts from main() function.

println!() and print!() are rust macros, which is how meta programming is done in rust.
Whenever calling a function with !, it means you're calling a macro instead of a normalfunction.

Macro: In Rust, a macro is a piece of code that generates another piece of code. 
    Macros are used for metaprogramming, allowing you to write code that writes more code. 
    They can simplify repetitive patterns, make code more concise, and enable you to create your own syntax or sub-language within Rust.

println!() and print!() are used to print the items in terminal when code is executed.
println!() adds the new line in the output while print!() don't.
The curly brackets tell println! to use formatting known as Display: output intended for direct end user consumption.
