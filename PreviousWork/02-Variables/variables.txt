Variables:
1. Assigned using "let" keyword.
2. Print to standard output by print!() or println!().
3. Scope of a variable defined by the block of code in which it's declared.
4. Function is a named block of code that is reusable.
5. Shadowing allows a variable to be re-declared in the same scope with the same name.
6. A variable can be used only if it's initialized.
7. "mut" is used to mark a variable as mutable: In rust, a variable by nature is immutable so you have to explicitly declare it as mutable using "mut" keyword.
